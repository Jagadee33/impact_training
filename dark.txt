Children start vanishing from the German town of Winden,[13] bringing to light the fractured relationships, double lives, and dark pasts of four families living there and unfurling a mystery that spans four generations.

The first season begins in 2019, but later grows to include 1986 and 1953 via time travel, when members of the show's central families become aware of a wormhole in the cave system beneath the local nuclear power plant. During the first season, secrets are revealed concerning the Kahnwald, Nielsen, Doppler, and Tiedemann families, and their lives begin crumbling as their ties are exposed. The conspiracy involves the missing children and the history of the town and its citizens.

The second season continues the families' attempts to reunite with their missing loved ones several months after the first-season finale, in 2020, 1987 and 1954, respectively. Additional storylines are set in 2053 and 1921. The second season introduces Sic Mundus Creatus Est, a major faction in the ongoing battle for the ultimate fate of the people of Winden and the world. The season counts down to the apocalypse.
